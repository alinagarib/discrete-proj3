# WHEEL OF QUOTES

Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manann/quotes-500k?resource=download

Our project, Wheel of Quotes, is based on the data set linked above. 
We took the raw data and put it into smaller, easily parsable .txt files, found 
in our cmake-build-debug (quotes.txt and quotes_3.txt).

For the functionality of the game, the user is prompted to choose from the menu of options.
To see our comparative algorithms at work, input 1. To play the game itself, input 2. To quit,
input 3.

To play the game itself, you are allowed 10 attempts to guess unique letters withing a quote that has 
missing characters, in the same fashion of Wheel of Fortune. Vowels count as 2 attempts. You may input
"!" to guess the final quote, in which case you will either win or lose. You may then input 1 to restart
or 2 to quit.

Finally, running the code yourself is quite easy. Simply clone the main branch on this github,
and it should run after you build it with no added files or downloads. There is no extraneous code or front end besides the CLI. 

Thank you and have a
wonderful day.
