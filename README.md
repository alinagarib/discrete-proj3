# WHEEL OF QUOTES

data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manann/quotes-500k?resource=download

For this project, we are reading in the dataset linked above, and developing a
game inspired by wheel of fortune. Users will select a quote category, and then
will be prompted with 10 tries to guess letters and the whole phrase given the 
author as a hint.
